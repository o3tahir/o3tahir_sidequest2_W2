## Description

I changed the freqeuncy of the blob, I made it so it moves faster an gives off the feeling of excitement. I wanted it to glide smoother on the floor. I changed the colour so it gives the feel of excitement by making it yellow and the background and steps to compliment it by being purple

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces
